# cathode-syntax theme

A sleek dark syntax theme for Atom, part of Moth's [FONC YOU](https://germanponte.com/moth/foncyou/) collection.

Cathode is a modern take on the Olden Monitor subject, in bluish, not-really-monochrome hues that submerge you in an ocean of cyberspatial electrons.

Perfect choice for hackers who work in monitor-lit lairs and retro-futuristic evil corporations intent on replacing humanity with robot dopplegÃ¤ngers.
